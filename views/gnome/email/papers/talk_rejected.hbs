Update on your GUADEC talk

Hello,

Thank you for submitting a talk for GUADEC 2016. We have had a lot of excellent submissions this year, with strong competition for the available slots. Unfortunately, we were not able to accept your talk, "{{paper.title}}", but we hope to still see you in Karlsruhe!

You can find more information about getting to Karlsruhe at https://2016.guadec.org/travel/#city . If you are planning to request travel sponsorship from the GNOME Foundation, please follow the process at https://wiki.gnome.org/Travel/Request using the latest form.

The recommended hotel this year will be ACHAT Plaza Karlsruhe: https://www.achat-hotels.com/en/hotel/karlsruhe-city . We will publish a discounted booking code as soon as it is available and alternative options will be added to the GUADEC website.


Best regards,
GUADEC papers committee
